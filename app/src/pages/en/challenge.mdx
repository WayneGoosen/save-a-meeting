<PageHeadline title='The Challenge' />

For one week, evaluate all the meetings in your calendar against the criteria on the Save a Meeting website. Use the value calculator and the defined meeting goal (if there isnâ€™t a goal, cancel the meeting already) to assess whether the meeting should take place (if you are the initiator) or if your attendance makes sense.

The primary objective is to shift your mindset from defaulting to meetings as the preferred communication medium. Additionally, treat the company (if you are an employee) as if it were your own. If it were your company, would you be happy with an employee setting up this meeting?
